# Role

This plugin provides role-specfic environment settings to be loaded. It looks
for `~/.role` and if found, loads the role-specific variables, aliases, and
functions defined there.

Currently, the list of role-specific env scripts include the following.

* **devcc** - CC dev box settings for work
* **home** - Home-related aliases and stuff
* **tv** - Env settings for the HTPC
* **work** - Work-related aliases and stuff
