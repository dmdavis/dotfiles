# .files @ dmdavis

This repository contains my personal collection of initialization and
configuration scripts. It was originally inspired by [Jeff Geerling's dotfiles][]
repo. For my old Bash-based configuration using [Bash-It][], see the `bash-it`
branch. I'm currently using [zimfw][] for my Z-shell configuration.

## Installation

To install, execute the following commands in a shell:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:dmdavis/dotfiles.git ~/.files && ~/.files/install
```

Cheers! :beer:
