# dotfiles
This repository contains my personal collection of initialization and configuration scripts.

After years of using Dropbox to manage and synchronize configuration files and shell scripts, I've moved to a git-backed model leveraging tools such as [dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot) and [zplug](https://github.com/b4b4r07/zplug) for installation and plugin management.

The goal is to be able to completely configuration my regular shell environment and tools by cloning the repository and running an installation script.
